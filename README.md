<p>I am a graduate of <span>Washington State University</span>, with a Bachelor's Degree in Social Science</p>
<p>I have worked in the grocery retail industry for many years, and dabbled in the Railroad service for a bit over a year before coming back.
As of right now I am attempting to immerse myself in to the world of web devolopment while continuing to advance my career within the retail grocery industry.</p>
<p>Hopefully some day I can become good enough in the web devolopment arena to make a full time career of it, but right now it is a hobby that I am thoroughly enjoying, and if anything further comes from it I would see it as a bonus as it is something I truly enjoy doing and it is fulfilling to continue learning such a useful and intrigueing skill set that is constantly evolving</p>
